She then told Epimetheus not to ever touch it or move it.<br>One night, after a few years in the village, Pandora woke up in the middle of the night and walked into the room where the box was. The moonlight was shining in through the window, and it made the box look bright and wonderful. The box itself was not fancy or special. It was just a common box with a large lock on the front. Pandora reached into her pocket and felt the key inside ,for she had kept the key there since Zeus had given it to her. The key felt warm in her hand and sent excitement through her body. Her curiosity grew and grew as she walked closer and closer to the box, but then she remembered Zeus’ words and turned away.<br><br>She got back into bed with Epimetheus, but was not able to sleep. She kept thinking about the box and wondering what was inside. Finally, Pandora got up and went to the room where the box sat. She carried the box outside into the garden, dug a deep hole in the middle of a group of flowers, and placed the box inside. She looked down at it one last time before covering it with the earth. She then took several large stones and piled them on top of the hole. She was tired from her work and returned to bed to sleep with Epimetheus.<br><br>As she slept, she had a dream about the box. In her dream, the box was bright and beautiful, and it softly whispered her name over and over again, “Pandora…Pandora…” it said.<br><br><br></font>

<h4 id="2-She-then-told-Epimetheus-not-to-ever-touch-it-or-move-it"><a href="#2-She-then-told-Epimetheus-not-to-ever-touch-it-or-move-it" class="headerlink" title="2.She then told Epimetheus not to ever touch it or move it."></a>2.She then told Epimetheus not to ever touch it or move it.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>Then和ever都放在动词之前，tell为不完全及物动词，为使役动词，后面接不定式为宾语补语。<br></font>

<h4 id="3-One-night-after-a-few-years-in-the-village-Pandora-woke-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-and-walked-into-the-room-where-the-box-was"><a href="#3-One-night-after-a-few-years-in-the-village-Pandora-woke-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-and-walked-into-the-room-where-the-box-was" class="headerlink" title="3.One night, after a few years in the village, Pandora woke up in the middle of the night and walked into the room where the box was."></a>3.One night, after a few years in the village, Pandora woke up in the middle of the night and walked into the room where the box was.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>Where表示in which，be动词后面可接地点副词短语做表语，由介词+地方名词形成，故后面的句子应该为the box was in room。然后转换成该形式。<br></font>

<h4 id="4-The-moonlight-was-shining-in-through-the-window-and-it-made-the-box-look-bright-and-wonderful"><a href="#4-The-moonlight-was-shining-in-through-the-window-and-it-made-the-box-look-bright-and-wonderful" class="headerlink" title="4.The moonlight was shining in through the window, and it made the box look bright and wonderful."></a>4.The moonlight was shining in through the window, and it made the box look bright and wonderful.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>这里的in为介副词，后面无宾语。Make后面仍然接原型不定式。<br></font>

<h4 id="5-The-box-itself-was-not-fancy-or-special"><a href="#5-The-box-itself-was-not-fancy-or-special" class="headerlink" title="5.The box itself was not fancy or special."></a>5.The box itself was not fancy or special.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>Itself的作用是强调主语。<br></font>

<h4 id="6-It-was-just-a-common-box-with-a-large-lock-on-the-front"><a href="#6-It-was-just-a-common-box-with-a-large-lock-on-the-front" class="headerlink" title="6.It was just a common box with a large lock on the front."></a>6.It was just a common box with a large lock on the front.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>注意just的位置，表示only时，放在动词后面。<br></font>

<h4 id="7-Pandora-reached-into-her-pocket-and-felt-the-key-inside-for-she-had-kept-the-key-there-since-Zeus-had-given-it-to-her"><a href="#7-Pandora-reached-into-her-pocket-and-felt-the-key-inside-for-she-had-kept-the-key-there-since-Zeus-had-given-it-to-her" class="headerlink" title="7.Pandora reached into her pocket and felt the key inside ,for she had kept the key there since Zeus had given it to her."></a>7.Pandora reached into her pocket and felt the key inside ,for she had kept the key there since Zeus had given it to her.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>Inside此处为介副词，后一句为for引导的条件句，since本来主句为现在完成时，从句为过去时，前一句话为过去式，导致了后面都变成了过去完成时。<br></font>

<h4 id="8-She-got-back-into-bed-with-Epimetheus-but-was-not-able-to-sleep-She-kept-thinking-about-the-box-and-wondering-what-was-inside"><a href="#8-She-got-back-into-bed-with-Epimetheus-but-was-not-able-to-sleep-She-kept-thinking-about-the-box-and-wondering-what-was-inside" class="headerlink" title="8.She got back into bed with Epimetheus, but was not able to sleep.

She kept thinking about the box and wondering what was inside.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>Keep后面接动名词短语做宾语，what相当于the thing which。<br></font>

<h4 id="9-She-got-back-into-bed-with-Epimetheus-but-was-not-able-to-sleep-She-kept-thinking-about-the-box-and-wondering-what-was-inside"><a href="#9-She-got-back-into-bed-with-Epimetheus-but-was-not-able-to-sleep-She-kept-thinking-about-the-box-and-wondering-what-was-inside" class="headerlink" title="9.She got back into bed with Epimetheus, but was not able to sleep. She kept thinking about the box and wondering what was inside."></a>9.She got back into bed with Epimetheus, but was not able to sleep. She kept thinking about the box and wondering what was inside.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>这里的inside为形容词，因为不完全及物动词后面多接形容词做宾补。<br></font>

<h4 id="10-She-looked-down-at-it-one-last-time-before-covering-it-with-the-earth"><a href="#10-She-looked-down-at-it-one-last-time-before-covering-it-with-the-earth" class="headerlink" title="10.She looked down at it one last time before covering it with the earth."></a>10.She looked down at it one last time before covering it with the earth.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>Down放在look之后，before后面接动名词短语。<br></font>

<h4 id="11-She-then-took-several-large-stones-and-piled-them-on-top-of-the-hole"><a href="#11-She-then-took-several-large-stones-and-piled-them-on-top-of-the-hole" class="headerlink" title="11.She then took several large stones and piled them on top of the hole."></a>11.She then took several large stones and piled them on top of the hole.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>On top of 不是 on the top of。<br></font>

<h4 id="12-She-was-tired-from-her-work-and-returned-to-bed-to-sleep-with-Epimetheus"><a href="#12-She-was-tired-from-her-work-and-returned-to-bed-to-sleep-with-Epimetheus" class="headerlink" title="12.She was tired from her work and returned to bed to sleep with Epimetheus."></a>12.She was tired from her work and returned to bed to sleep with Epimetheus.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>To+动词才叫不定式短语。否则to为介词，to sleep with Epimetheus为不定式短语做副词。<br></font>

<h4 id="13-In-her-dream-the-box-was-bright-and-beautiful-and-it-softly-whispered-her-name-over-and-over-again-“Pandora…Pandora…”-it-said"><a href="#13-In-her-dream-the-box-was-bright-and-beautiful-and-it-softly-whispered-her-name-over-and-over-again-“Pandora…Pandora…”-it-said" class="headerlink" title="13.In her dream, the box was bright and beautiful, and it softly whispered her name over and over again, “Pandora…Pandora…” it said."></a>13.In her dream, the box was bright and beautiful, and it softly whispered her name over and over again, “Pandora…Pandora…” it said.</h4><font size="4" face="微软雅黑"><br>“Pandora…Pandora…” it said.可以把it said 放后面。<br></font>
