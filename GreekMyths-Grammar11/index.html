Finally Orpheus could not bear it any longer and took a quick look behind him. The moment he did this, many servants of Hades flew down and grasped Eurydice. As they pulled her back into Hades, Orpheus ran up to her and grasped her hand. They touched each other one last time before she was pulled away.<br><br>Eurydice looked at her husband with deep love and did not blame him for his impatience for how could she be angry at his desire to see her? “Goodbye, my love,” she said, “a fi¬nal goodbye.” She then disappeared into the darkness.<br>Suddenly Orpheus found himself back in the light of the world. The entrance to the cave was covered with large rocks that he could not move. He begged the gods to let him back into Hades to try one more time, but he received no answer. He sat at the cave entrance for three days and nights, without food or water. He then played his lyre and sang a song so sad that everything that heard it felt that their heart would break. The wild animals could not bear to hear a song so sad and begged him to stop. Orpheus refused, and the animals, crazy with sadness, attacked him and pulled him into hundreds of tiny pieces.<br><br>His spirit, free from his body, fell happily into Hades where he sought out his Eurydice and held her in his arms. They still walk together happily in Hades, his playing the lyre and her singing, and Orpheus may look at her as much as he wishes, without fear of her disappearing from his arms.<br><br><br><br></font>
