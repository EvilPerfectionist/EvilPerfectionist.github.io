## <font color=#0099ff><center> Pandora’s Box (the last part)</center></font> ##

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
Suddenly, Pandora’s suffering lessened, and she had the strength to sit up again.

The tiny woman hung in the air before her face, “I am called Hope,” she said. “I am the last of the things in thebox. Through your curiosity, you have released many terrible forces into the world. Each of these forces has a name: Old Age, Sickness, Misery, Selfishness, Greed, and Ugliness, The people of earth will no longer live easy lives, but I am the Hope that will give them the strength to fight these forces. I wish that I could do more, but that is the best that can be done.”

Then Hope flew away and a golden light followed her. From that day on, people began to get sick, grow old, and die. But they would always have Hope to help them. This was the punishment of Zeus upon men for taking fire from the gods.

#### 1.Suddenly, Pandora’s suffering lessened, and she had the strength to sit up again. 

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
To sit up again 为不定式短语做形容词，形容strength。
</font>

#### 2.The tiny woman hung in the air before her face, “I am called Hope,” she said. “I am the last of the things in the box. 
 
<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
I am called Hope中be called something为固定用法。注意引语中都要用一般现在时。
</font>

#### 3.Each of these forces has a name: Old Age, Sickness, Misery, Selfishness, Greed, and Ugliness. 

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
注意这种句型的使用。
</font>

#### 4.The people of earth will no longer live easy lives, but I am the Hope that will give them the strength to fight these forces.

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
是The people of earth 而不是The people of the earth，no longer为副词短语表示不再，no more虽等于no longer，但仅见于诗歌中，使用时，多置于句尾，或置于句首采用倒装结构，不可置于句中。Live为不及物动词，不及物动词可做及物动词，用同系名词做其宾语，比如dream a terrible dream，此时的live easy lives也是这道理。
</font>

#### 5.I wish that I could do more, but that is the best that can be done.”

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
That引导名词性从句，这里的more为代词。
</font>

#### 6.From that day on, people began to get sick, grow old, and die.

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
注意这种动词连用的句型。
</font>

#### 7.This was the punishment of Zeus upon men for taking fire from the gods.

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
注意upon men，for taking fire from the gods为介词短语，for表目的，taking fire动名词短语为for的宾语。
</font>
