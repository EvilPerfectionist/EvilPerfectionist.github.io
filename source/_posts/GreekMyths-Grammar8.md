## <font color=#0099ff><center> Orpheus and Eurydice(continue the story from the previous post)</center></font> ##

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">

When Orpheus found her body, he begged the god’s to let her live, but his cries were not heard. For days he cried beside her body, not eating or sleeping. Finally, Orpheus decided to go down into Hades ‘ the land of the dead ’ and find his wife. He asked Apollo, his father, to tell him where the entrance into Hades was, and Apollo led him to a cave on the side of a great cliff. Smoke poured out of the mouth of the cave and terrible screams could be heard from inside, but Orpheus’ love for Eurydice, and his determination to find her, were so great that he was not afraid.

He entered into the cave and instantly the light of the world outside disappeared. Great crowds of ghosts surrounded him as he walked down the long staircase into the center of Hades. They whispered terrible words that Orpheus could not understand. A normal man would have been killed quickly on entering Hades, but Orplieus had his lyre and played such sweet music that the guards of the underworld let him pass.

After many hours the stairs finally ended and Orpheus arrived in the center of Hades, The god of Hades sat in his great chair with his wife, and Orpheus bowed before them. Orpheus then began to play his lyre and sing:

#### 1.When Orpheus found her body, he begged the god’s to let her live, but his cries were not heard. 

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">

beg somebody to do something 所以这里的god’s应该改为gods，注意live做动词和做形容词，副词时候的读音不同，cry做名词可数。

</font>

#### 2.For days he cried beside her body, not eating or sleeping. 

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">

若两个动词所代表的动作同时发生时，第二个动词一定要变成现在分词，若该动词为be动词，变成现在分词being之后要省略。Eating和sleeping就是这道理。

</font>

#### 3.He asked Apollo, his father, to tell him where the entrance into Hades was, and Apollo led him to a cave on the side of a great cliff. .

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
这里的where可以视为疑问代词，引导名词性从句，此时可做及物动词的宾语，类似于I know where he is。
</font>

#### 4.Smoke poured out of the mouth of the cave and terrible screams could be heard from inside, but Orpheus’ love for Eurydice, and his determination to find her, were so great that he was not afraid.

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
Pour out of 为固定用法，像这种动词后面跟介词的，字典里后面通常都会写上[intransitive always + adverb/preposition]，inside也可以做名词。
</font>

#### 5.A normal man would have been killed quickly on entering Hades, but Orplieus had his lyre and played such sweet music that the guards of the underworld let him pass.

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
本句为虚拟语气，would have + 过去分词表达与过去事实相反，on+动名词表示as soon as 时也可以放句子后面，注意so……that和such……that的区别，so后面是强调形容词或副词，that后面强调名词。
</font>

#### 6.After many hours the stairs finally ended and Orpheus arrived in the center of Hades.

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">
注意这里用arrive in 指一个地区时候用in。
</font>
