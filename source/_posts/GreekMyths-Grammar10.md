## <font color=#0099ff><center> Orpheus and Eurydice(continue the story from the previous post)</center></font> ##

<font size=4 face="微软雅黑">

You must walk up the stairs out of Hades and not turn back to look at her or this world. Not until you have arrived back in the world of the liv-ing can you turn around. If you wish to see your wife, just look into my tear that you now hold in your hand and you will see her, like in a mirror, behind you.”

Orpheus began the long walk up the stairs, all the while holding the god’s single tear up in front of him to see his wife behind him. In the tear he saw Eurydice following behind him as best she could. Her foot still hurt from the snake bite, and she walked slowly and silently. The stairs were dark and high, and Eurydice often slipped because of her hurt foot. Each time she slipped, Orpheus wished to run to her, but knew he could not. They walked an hour, and a terrible thought appeared in Orpheus’ head. “What if Hades has tricked me into leaving the Land of the dead, and Eurydice is not really behind me?” This thought became bigger and bigger inside of Orpheus’ head, until he could not think of anything else. He called out to Eurydice, begging her to answer him, but heard no reply.
